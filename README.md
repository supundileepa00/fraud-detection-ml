## Requirements:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib

In this project we try to detect credit card transactions fraud detection using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and as the dataset: [Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection?datasetId=817870&searchQuery=svm) provided by Kaggle. For this analysis I focused more on data preprocessing because it helps to gain a better accuracy rather than just sending raw data and telling to build a model.
